## What to Explain to Another System

### One-Paragraph Summary

> **BWGA Intelligence AI** is an enterprise partnership intelligence platform that guides strategic decision-makers through a structured 6-stage analysis workflow. Users define their organization, then progress through market analysis, compatibility evaluation, opportunity discovery, strategic planning, expansion design, and finally report generation. The system combines 16 independent analytical modules (market comparison, financial modeling, AI recommendations, cost optimization, etc.) that activate sequentially, feeding all results into a comprehensive pre-feasibility dossier with success scoring and export capabilities. The core innovation is the workflow-driven architecture—modules are never presented as overwhelming choices, but naturally discovered as users progress through the decision-making journey.

### Key Technical Details

**Architecture Type**: Component-based state machine with unidirectional data flow

**Core State**: `ReportParameters` object (70+ fields) flows through all 16 features unchanged

**Workflow**: 7 stages (Gateway → Definition → 6 Analytical Stages → Export)

**Data Flow**: User Input → Feature 1 → Feature 2 → ... → Feature 16 → Export

**Module Independence**: Features don't import each other; all communication via shared state

**Scalability**: Add new features by creating new components that read/write ReportParameters

## Critical Concepts to Convey

### 1. The Workflow is Sacred
```
DO NOT FLATTEN IT
DO NOT SKIP STAGES
DO NOT CHANGE THE SEQUENCE

Correct:   Gateway → Definition → Stage1 → Stage2 → ... → Export
Wrong:     Show all features on landing page (this was the mistake we fixed)
```

### 2. Features Are Independent
```
GOOD:  Feature 1 reads ReportParameters → updates → Feature 2 reads updated
BAD:   Feature 1 imports Feature 2 → Feature 2 imports Feature 3 → circular

Solution: All communication through shared state (ReportParameters)
```

### 3. State Structure is Fixed
```
DO NOT REMOVE FIELDS
DO NOT RENAME FIELDS
DO NOT CHANGE TYPES

Can do: Add new fields
Can't do: Remove/rename/retype existing fields

Why: All 16 features depend on current structure
```

### 4. Two Types of Files
```
PLATFORM AGNOSTIC (Copy exactly):
- types.ts (interfaces)
- constants.ts (defaults)
- services/engine.ts (calculations)
- services/ruleEngine.ts (rules)

PLATFORM SPECIFIC (Rewrite for target):
- App.tsx (use your routing)
- All .tsx files (use your framework syntax)
- services/geminiService.ts (use your LLM)
- services/mockDataGenerator.ts (use your data)
```

## Time to Rebuild Elsewhere

### Minimum (Best Case)
- Framework: Same as original (React)
- Data source: Ready to integrate
- Team: 3+ developers
- **Time: 1-2 weeks**

### Realistic (Normal Case)
- Framework: Different (Vue, Angular)
- Data source: Some API work needed
- Team: 2 developers
- **Time: 4-6 weeks**

### Conservative (Safe Case)
- Framework: Very different (backend-driven)
- Data source: Needs significant work
- Team: 1 developer
- **Time: 8-12 weeks**

**Factors**:
- Familiarity with target framework: ±1 week
- Data source complexity: ±2 weeks
- Testing requirements: ±1 week
- Deployment infrastructure: ±1 week
