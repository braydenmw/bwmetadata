# System Enhancement Complete - What You Have Now

## Your Request (Paraphrased)

> "The metadata sections need brief descriptions. The system should be designed for anyone at any experience level. The AI consultant should ask the person to pick their experience level, which sets the help level. Include what can be added. Provide documents that can be picked (no limit) and letters that cover all areas to help contact those they want to engage."
