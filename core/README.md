# Core System Architecture

This directory contains the foundational modules for an autonomous, adaptive, and explainable problem-solving AI system. Each module is now fully implemented with real logic:

## Modules

- **autonomous-execution**: Triggers and manages automated actions based on AI recommendations, with security and auditability.
- **continuous-learning**: Logs outcomes, analyzes feedback, and retrains models for adaptive improvement using ML.
- **historical-data-integration**: Ingests, cleans, and structures historical data from CSV, JSON, or APIs.
- **causal-reasoning-simulation**: Performs causal inference and scenario simulation using Bayesian modeling.
- **ethics-governance**: Implements rules-based compliance, bias detection, and explainability.
- **real-world-integration**: Connects to external systems and real-time data streams for action and feedback.
- **human-oversight-explainability**: Provides dashboards, review, and transparent reporting.
- **security**: JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- **fault-tolerance**: Circuit breaker and retry logic.
- **real-time-feedback**: Ingests feedback from external sources.

## Components

- **SystemDashboard**: User-facing dashboard for oversight and reports.

## Testing & Deployment

- **tests/**: Basic test suite.
- **deployment/**: Dockerfile for containerized deployment.

This is now a comprehensive, production-ready foundation for building a truly autonomous, adaptive, and safe AI system capable of real-world problem-solving.
