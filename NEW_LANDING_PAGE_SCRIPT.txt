// DESIGN NOTE: ICON & COLOR CONSISTENCY
// Ensure all icons are from the same family (e.g., Material, Feather, or custom set) and use a unified style (filled/outline, line weight, etc.).
// Color palette must match the brand guidelines. Audit all UI elements for off-brand colors and update to the approved palette before launch.
// Remove or replace any mismatched icons or colors immediately.
