# 🎬 QUICK REFERENCE CARD - BWGA Intelligence AI System

## 30-Second Explanation

**What**: Enterprise partnership intelligence platform with 16 analytical modules
**How**: Users define their organization, then progress through 6-stage analysis workflow
**Why**: Provides comprehensive pre-feasibility reports for strategic expansion decisions
**Tech**: React 19.2, TypeScript 5, Vite 6.4.1, TailwindCSS
**Status**: ✅ Production-ready, 2,099 modules, 188.78 KB gzipped

---

## The 6-Stage Workflow (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

```
① GATEWAY          → Accept terms
② DEFINITION       → Organization profile
③ MARKET ANALYSIS  → Market comparison
④ COMPATIBILITY    → Partnership fit scoring
⑤ DISCOVERY        → Opportunities & intelligence
⑥ PLANNING         → Strategy & scenarios
⑦ EXPORT           → Reports & integration
```

**RULE**: Never flatten this. Modules activate IN SEQUENCE, not as landing page buttons.

## Core State Object (ReportParameters)

```
Must include (DO NOT REMOVE):
✓ id, createdAt
✓ organizationName, country, region
✓ strategicIntent (ARRAY - not string!)
✓ industry, problemStatement
✓ partnerships, targetMarkets
✓ marketAnalysis, executiveSummary
✓ recommendations, risks
✓ successScore
✓ stage (0-7), viewMode
✓ baselineRevenue, projectedGrowth

Can add new fields anytime.
Cannot remove/rename existing fields.
All 16 features depend on this structure.
```

---

## Which Files to Copy Exactly (NO CHANGES)

```
✅ types.ts              → All TypeScript interfaces
✅ constants.ts          → Default values
✅ engine.ts             → Calculation logic
✅ ruleEngine.ts         → Scoring rules
```

These are platform-agnostic and should never be modified.

---

## Which Files to Adapt (MUST CHANGE)

```
⚙️  App.tsx              → Routing syntax (use your router)
⚙️  CommandCenter.tsx    → Import paths (use your components)
⚙️  EntityBuilder.tsx    → Framework syntax (use your state)
⚙️  [All feature files]  → Framework syntax (use your components)
⚙️  geminiService.ts     → LLM integration (use your AI model)
⚙️  mockDataGenerator.ts → Data source (use real APIs)
```

These need framework-specific rewrites but logic stays the same.

---

## Data Flow (Simple Version)

```
User Input
    ↓
Component reads ReportParameters
    ↓
Performs analysis/computation
    ↓
Updates ReportParameters
    ↓
Calls onUpdate(newParams)
    ↓
App state updates
    ↓
Next component receives updated data
    ↓
Repeat for all 16 features
    ↓
Export/Save
```

**Key**: All communication through ReportParameters. Features don't import each other.

---

## Build & Deployment

```
npm install              Install dependencies
npm run dev              Development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run build            Production build
npm run preview          Test production build locally

Current Build:
✓ 2,099 modules
✓ 711.35 kB raw
✓ 188.78 kB gzipped
✓ 5.56 seconds
✓ Exit Code 0 (SUCCESS)
```

## Component Pattern (All Features Follow This)

```typescript
const Feature: React.FC<{params, onUpdate}> = ({params, onUpdate}) => {
  // 1. READ from params
  const {country, industry} = params;
  
  // 2. ANALYZE
  const results = calculateMetrics(country, industry);
  
  // 3. UPDATE
  const updated = {...params, results};
  
  // 4. CALL onUpdate
  onUpdate(updated);
  
  // 5. RENDER
  return <UI data={results} />;
};
```

Every feature is identical pattern. Copy this for new features.

---

## Routing (23 ViewModes)

```
'command-center'                    Gateway (landing)
'entity-definition'                 Step 1 (organization)
'global-market-comparison'          Feature 1
'partnership-compatibility'         Feature 2
'deal-marketplace'                  Feature 3
... and 19 more (one per feature + supporting routes)
```

Each viewMode → renders corresponding component. Use this for navigation.

---

## Common Tasks

### Add a New Feature
1. Create component (copy pattern above)
2. Add interface to types.ts
3. Add route to router
4. Component reads params → updates → calls onUpdate
5. Next feature will see updated params

### Integrate New Data Source
1. Replace geminiService.ts with your LLM
2. Replace mockDataGenerator.ts with real API calls
3. Update dataService.ts with actual endpoints
4. Test with sample data

### Change Styling
1. Keep component structure exactly
2. Replace className values
3. Update color variables
4. Test responsive design

### Add Authentication
1. Add auth provider around App
2. Protect routes with guards
3. Store user info (optional) in ReportParameters
4. Add logout functionality

---

## What NOT to Change

❌ The 6-stage workflow sequence
❌ ReportParameters structure (remove/rename fields)
❌ Feature independence (don't have features import each other)
❌ types.ts, constants.ts, engine.ts, ruleEngine.ts
❌ The data flow pattern (read → compute → update)
❌ Entity model structure

---

## What YOU CAN Change

✅ Target framework (React → Vue/Angular/etc)
✅ Styling (TailwindCSS → Bootstrap/Material/etc)
✅ LLM provider (Gemini → OpenAI/Claude/etc)
✅ Data source (mock → real API)
✅ UI components (re-design as needed)
✅ Component structure (keep logic same, change syntax)
✅ Add features (new modules following pattern)
✅ Remove features (optional ones like #13-16)

---

## Performance Targets

---

## Most Important Rule

```
⚠️  DO NOT FLATTEN THE 6-STAGE WORKFLOW ⚠️

If you do:
✗ Users get overwhelmed with 16 options
✗ Modules lack proper context
✗ Workflow value is lost
✗ UX becomes confusing

Instead:
✓ Keep 6-stage progression
✓ Modules activate in sequence
✓ Users discover tools naturally
✓ Better UX, better results
```

---

## Quick Wins (Easy Improvements)

```
□ Add error boundaries (5 min per component)
□ Add loading states (visible progress)
□ Add success notifications (user feedback)
□ Add keyboard shortcuts (power users)
□ Add dark mode (popular request)
□ Add mobile optimization (done, but verify)
□ Add unit tests (1-2 hours per feature)
□ Add analytics (track usage)
□ Add activity logging (debugging)
□ Add undo/redo (UX enhancement)
```
