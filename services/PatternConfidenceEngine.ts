 * The layer that sits above formula computation. Before any formula runs,

 * pattern. If they do, baseline confidence is elevated and the output is

 *
 * Foundational principle:
 *   "The past isn't historical interest. The past is the solution library."
 *
 * Design rules:
 *   1. Known methodology â†’ high confidence, authoritative language
 *   2. Partial match       â†’ standard confidence, note which elements are novel
 *   3. No match            â†’ standard computation, flag as genuinely uncertain
