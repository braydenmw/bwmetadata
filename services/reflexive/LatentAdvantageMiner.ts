 * Theory: "Junk DNA" Concept + Hidden Asset Theory +
 *         Porter's Diamond (under-recognised factor conditions)
 *
 * The Biology Metaphor:
 *   For decades, geneticists dismissed 98% of DNA as "junk" because they
 *   couldn't see its function. Then they discovered it regulated everything.
 *   The "junk DNA" was the most important part.
 *
 * The Regional Economics Parallel:
 *   When a region describes itself, it leads with what it thinks investors
 *   want: tax rates, labour costs, industrial zones. But buried in the
 *   description are casual mentions of assets that are — historically and
 *   globally — among the most powerful investment attractors:
 *
 *   "We have a small port" → Ports cannot be replicated. Ever.
 *   "There's a university nearby" → University anchors persist through cycles.
 *   "Many of our people work overseas" → Diaspora = investment channel.
 *   "We have nice beaches" → Lifestyle = tech talent magnet.
 *   "It rains a lot" → Hydroelectric potential.
 *   "We're near the border" → Cross-border economic zone potential.
 *
 * This engine scans every input field for casually mentioned assets that
 * the user doesn't realise are strategically significant, cross-references
 * against a library of historical cases where those assets created
 * transformative value, and surfaces them with evidence.
