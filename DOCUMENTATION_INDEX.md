## ðŸ“ How to Use These Documents

### Scenario 1: Explaining to Another AI System

**Send these files in this order**:
1. Start with **HANDOFF_GUIDE.md** (quick overview)
2. Then **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md** (deep dive)
3. Then **ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md** (visual understanding)
4. Finally **PORTING_GUIDE.md** (if they'll implement)

**Example prompt to other AI**:
```
I have a React-based partnership intelligence platform that needs to be 
ported to [Vue/Angular/other framework]. Here are the documentation files 
explaining the system. Please:

1. Understand the 6-stage workflow (critical, cannot be changed)
2. Identify the 16 independent feature components
3. Note the core ReportParameters state object
4. Plan the port using PORTING_GUIDE.md
5. Start with infrastructure (types, state, routing)
6. Then port services (keep engine.ts unchanged)
7. Then port features in order
8. Then integrate and test
```

---

### Scenario 2: Team Implementation

**Week 1 (Planning & Setup)**:
- All team reads **HANDOFF_GUIDE.md**
- Tech lead studies **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md** + **ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md**
- Setup new project per **PORTING_GUIDE.md** Phase 1-2

**Week 2-3 (Implementation)**:
- Backend team: Port services (Phase 3 of guide)
- Frontend team: Port features in parallel (Phase 4 of guide)
- UI/UX team: Implement styling (Phase 5 of guide)

**Week 4 (Testing & Deployment)**:
- QA team: Integration testing (Phase 6 of guide)
- DevOps: Setup deployment (Phase 7 of guide)

---

### Scenario 3: Code Reuse in Other Projects

**Want to reuse components?**
- Copy individual feature components
- Ensure they receive ReportParameters prop
- Ensure they have onUpdate handler
- Ensure you import their dependencies
- Test in isolation first

**Want to reuse business logic?**
- Copy services/ folder (platform-agnostic)
- Update imports for your project
- No framework changes needed

**Want to reuse state structure?**
- Copy types.ts interfaces
- Adapt to your state management
- Keep field names and structure

âœ… Well-structured components
âœ… Modular design
âš ï¸  234 linting warnings (non-critical)
â—‹  Could benefit from unit tests
â—‹  Could benefit from error boundaries
â—‹  Could benefit from more logging
```

### Linting Issues Breakdown
```
Unused imports:        ~40 instances (low priority)
Unused variables:      ~30 instances (low priority)
Unused states:         ~20 instances (low priority)
Unsafe any types:      ~15 instances (medium priority)

## ðŸ“ž Questions & Answers

### Q: Can I skip any features?
**A**: Technically yes, but the workflow expects all 6 stages. Skip individual features (13-16) if needed, but keep the structure.

### Q: Can I change the ReportParameters structure?
**A**: Add fields yes, remove/rename no. All 16 features depend on the current structure.

### Q: Can I flatten the 6-stage workflow?
**A**: No. The workflow progression is the core value proposition. Don't flatten it.

### Q: Can I port just part of this?
**A**: Yes. You could port the core analytics (Features 1-7) and skip the advanced ones (13-16).

### Q: What if I want to use different styling?
**A**: Copy the component logic, reimplement the UI with your framework. The algorithms are what matters.

### Q: How do I integrate with my existing system?
**A**: Use the IntegrationExportFramework (Feature 15) or adapt the services layer to call your APIs.

### Q: Can I add authentication?
**A**: Yes. Wrap the app with an auth provider, protect routes, store user context in ReportParameters.

### Q: What about database persistence?
**A**: Implement a data service that calls your backend instead of localStorage.
