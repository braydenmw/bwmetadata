───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    5. RISK ASSESSMENT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

THE SKEPTIC'S VIEW:

"This project carries meaningful emerging market risk. While the 
strategic rationale is sound, the Executive Committee should be 
aware of the following concerns:"

HIGH PRIORITY RISKS:

1. REGULATORY RISK (Impact: High | Probability: Medium)
   The Philippines offshore wind regulatory framework is nascent.
   Key uncertainties include:
   - Service contract award timing (DOE backlog)
   - Environmental clearance process (untested for offshore)
   - Grid connection priority disputes
   
   MITIGATION: Early DOE engagement, experienced local counsel, 
   phase-gate structure linking equity release to permit milestones.

2. POLITICAL RISK (Impact: High | Probability: Low-Medium)
   2028 national elections may shift energy policy.
   Current administration is supportive, but successors unknown.
   
   MITIGATION: Bilateral investment treaty protection (Denmark-PH),
   political risk insurance (MIGA), broad stakeholder coalition.

3. CONSTRUCTION RISK (Impact: Medium | Probability: Medium)
   Limited offshore installation capability in Philippines.
   Will require importing heavy-lift vessels from Taiwan/Japan.
   
   MITIGATION: Early vessel booking, fixed-price EPC structure,
   detailed logistics planning, contingency budget.

MODERATE PRIORITY RISKS:

4. CURRENCY RISK (Impact: Medium | Probability: High)
   PHP has depreciated 3.5% annually vs USD (5-year average).
   Revenue in PHP, debt service in USD creates natural mismatch.
   
   MITIGATION: USD-linked PPA clause, natural hedge through 
   local cost base, hedging program for debt service.

5. COUNTERPARTY RISK (Impact: Medium | Probability: Low)
   AC Energy is well-capitalized but may have competing priorities.
   
   MITIGATION: Robust JV agreement, staged equity calls, 
   termination rights for material breach.

RISK RATING: MODERATE (Proceed with enhanced monitoring)

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                    6. GOVERNANCE & APPROVALS

                    RECOMMENDATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: AC ENERGY CORPORATION

RATIONALE:
AC Energy scores highest due to:
1. Strongest renewable energy focus (4.3 GW, 100% renewables)
2. Existing offshore wind pipeline (1.2 GW under development)
3. Best ESG alignment with Vestas values
4. Clear strategic rationale (Ayala clean energy mandate)
5. Strong governance and transparency standards

NEGOTIATION LEVERAGE:
- Vestas technology is differentiated (V236-15.0 platform)
- AC Energy needs experienced offshore partner
- Timeline pressure (DOE service contract windows)
- Competition from Siemens Gamesa creates urgency

FALLBACK OPTION: ABOITIZ POWER

If AC Energy negotiations fail, Aboitiz is a credible alternative:
- Stronger balance sheet (BBB vs BBB-)
- More diversified portfolio (less single-project risk)
- Slightly weaker renewable focus but transitioning

AVOID: SMC GLOBAL POWER

Despite largest scale, SMC is not recommended due to:
- Weak ESG profile (high coal exposure)
- Governance concerns (conglomerate complexity)
- Less strategic alignment with Vestas sustainability brand
