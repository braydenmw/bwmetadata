- **After**: 9-section comprehensive intake with complete data model, validation engine, and professional-grade forms

### Key Metrics
- **9 Intake Sections**: Identity → Mandate → Market → Partners → Financial → Risks → Capabilities → Execution → Governance
- **~500+ Structured Fields**: Complete data model across all sections
- **Validation Engine**: Readiness scoring (Red/Yellow/Green) with gap analysis
- **~50 Subsections**: Detailed form organization with collapsible sections
- **Professional Tools**: ROI calculators, risk matrices, capability assessments, governance frameworks

## THE 9 COMPREHENSIVE SECTIONS EXPLAINED

### 1️⃣ IDENTITY & FOUNDATION (Section 1)
**"Who Are You?"** - Establish organizational credibility
- Organization legal profile (type, jurisdiction, incorporation)
- Organizational capacity (revenue, headcount, segments, market share)
- Structure (decision makers, board, advisors)
- Competitive positioning (competitors, advantages, IP, brand)
- Financial stability (credit, debt, liquidity)

**Why It Matters**: No partner will work with unknown or incredible organizations

---

### 2️⃣ MANDATE & STRATEGY (Section 2)
**"Why Are You Here?"** - Define strategic clarity
- Strategic vision (3-5 year outlook, problem statement)
- Objectives & KPIs (measurable targets, timelines)
- Target partner profile (size, industry, geography, culture)
- Value proposition (what you bring, win-win framework)
- Governance model (JV / Alliance / License / Distribution / Equity)

**Why It Matters**: Unclear mandates lead to misaligned partnerships and failed execution

---

### 3️⃣ MARKET & CONTEXT (Section 3)
**"Where Are You Going?"** - Understand market forces
- Market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM, growth rate, maturity)
- Market dynamics (trends, competition, pricing, disruption)
- Geographic context (local market size, regulations, macro)
- Macroeconomic factors (GDP, inflation, currency, trade)
- Industry-specific dynamics (consolidation, pricing power)

**Why It Matters**: Market forces are more powerful than plans - understand them or fail

---

### 4️⃣ PARTNERS & ECOSYSTEM (Section 4)
**"Who Else Is Involved?"** - Evaluate partner fit
- Target counterparties (names, size, capabilities)
- Stakeholder landscape (executive, operational, financial, legal)
- Strategic alignment (goals, timeline, risk tolerance)
- Cultural fit (decision speed, hierarchy, innovation)
- Competitive conflicts (channel conflict, non-competes)
- Relationship dynamics (history, trust, prior dealings)

**Why It Matters**: 70% of partnerships fail due to misalignment - force honest assessment upfront

---

### 5️⃣ FINANCIAL MODEL (Section 5)
**"The Money"** - Build complete financial picture
- Investment requirements (capital, timing, sources)
- Revenue model (streams, unit economics, Y1/Y3/Y5)
- Cost structure (COGS, OpEx, headcount plan)
- Return analysis (break-even, margin, NPV, IRR, payback)
- Scenarios (base case, downside -25%, upside +25%)
- Sensitivity analysis (key drivers, impact on IRR)

**Why It Matters**: "The business case is always wrong, but it forces you to think"

---

### 6️⃣ RISK & MITIGATION (Section 6)
**"What Could Go Wrong?"** - Systematically manage risks
- Risk register (5+ risks by category: market, ops, financial, legal, relationship)
- Risk quantification (probability %, impact $)
- Mitigation plans (how to reduce each risk)
- Contingency planning (if X happens, then do Y)
- Risk appetite (acceptable level: low/medium/high)

**Why It Matters**: Risk management separates professionals from amateurs

---

### 7️⃣ CAPABILITIES & RESOURCES (Section 7)
**"Can You Execute?"** - Audit your ability
- Executive team (names, backgrounds, criticality, bench)
- Organizational capabilities (rated 1-5 scale)
- Technology stack (core engine, platforms, integrations)
- Team & talent gaps (what roles are needed)
- Build vs. Buy vs. Partner decisions

**Why It Matters**: Great plans fail with weak teams - reveal execution risk early

---

### 8️⃣ EXECUTION PLAN (Section 8)
**"HOW & WHEN?"** - Create realistic roadmap with gates
- Phase 1: Foundation (months 1-3) - setup, approvals, team
- Phase 2: Ramp (months 4-9) - launch, scaling, decisions
- Phase 3: Scale (months 10-18+) - enterprise operations, validation
- Go/No-Go criteria (what must be true to proceed)
- Critical path (items that can't slip without cascading delays)
- Dependencies (what blocks what, parallel workstreams)

**Why It Matters**: "In the absence of a plan, everyone has a different plan"

---

### 9️⃣ GOVERNANCE & MONITORING (Section 9)
**"HOW Do You Stay Aligned?"** - Ongoing decision-making
- Steering committee (members, frequency, authority)
- Decision authority matrix (who decides what)
- Key metrics & dashboards (financial, operational, strategic KPIs)
- Meeting cadence (how often, escalation paths)
- Contingency triggers ("If X happens, then...")

**Why It Matters**: The deal doesn't end when you sign - stay on track and adapt
