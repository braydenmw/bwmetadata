## How It Works

### Generating a Document

1. User selects document type(s) from the library
2. User chooses page length (1-100 pages)
3. User optionally enables:
   - Pros/Cons Analysis
   - Alternative Options
   - AI Debate Mode
4. System generates document with:
   - Full sections per template
   - Unbiased analysis section (if enabled)
   - Alternative recommendations (if enabled)
   - Multi-perspective debate summary (if enabled)
5. User can preview, download PDF or DOCX

### Running Analysis

1. Click "Analysis" tab
2. System analyzes current parameters
3. Displays:
   - **Pros** with weight scores (1-10) and evidence
   - **Cons** with weight scores (1-10) and evidence
   - **Overall Recommendation** (Proceed / Proceed with Caution / Reconsider / Not Recommended)
   - **Confidence Level** (percentage)
   - **Alternative Options** with comparison to user's choice

### Running Debate

1. Click "Debate" tab
2. Click "Start AI Debate"
3. Three AI personas present arguments:
   - **FOR** (Growth-Focused Strategist)
   - **AGAINST** (Risk-Conscious Advisor)
   - **NEUTRAL** (Balanced Analyst)
4. Each position includes:
   - Arguments
   - Evidence
   - Counterarguments
   - Rebuttals
   - Confidence level
5. Synthesis shows:
   - Common ground
   - Irreconcilable differences
   - Recommended path
   - Risk if wrong
   - User action items

## Integration Points

### App.tsx
- `viewMode === 'document-generation'` now renders `EnhancedDocumentGenerator`
- `viewMode === 'document-suite'` now renders `EnhancedDocumentGenerator`
- Both pass `params` for context-aware generation

### Usage
```tsx
<EnhancedDocumentGenerator
  params={params}
  className="m-4"
/>
```
